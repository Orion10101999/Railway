[A] Lord Dalhousie

[B] Lord Canning

[C] Lord Elphinstone

[D] Lord Curzon


The correct answer is:

[B] Lord Canning

Lord Canning, the Governor-General of India from 1856 to 1862, championed the cause of female education and made an annual donation towards this. He believed that education was essential for the empowerment of women and the development of society.

Lord Canning's efforts led to the establishment of the first women's college in India, the Bethune College in Kolkata, in 1849. He also encouraged the setting up of schools for girls and provided financial support for female education.


Other options are incorrect because:

- Lord Dalhousie (1848-1856) focused on infrastructure development, such as railways, roads, and telegraphs.
- Lord Elphinstone (1819-1827) was more focused on administrative reforms and expansion of British territories.
- Lord Curzon (1899-1905) was known for his conservation efforts and establishment of the Archaeological Survey of India, but not particularly for female education.
