## Q.9. Which of the following regions has the highest potential for wind energy ?

[A] The Deccan Plateau

[B] Gangetic planes

[C] Western Ghats

[D] The Himalayas

The correct answer is:


[A] The Deccan Plateau


The Deccan Plateau region has the highest potential for wind energy in India due to its:


1. High wind speeds (average 5-7 m/s)
2. Large land area
3. Low topography
4. Proximity to coastal areas (enhancing wind flow)


Reasons why:


1. Trade winds from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal bring strong winds to the Deccan Plateau.
2. The region's terrain allows for smooth wind flow.


Other regions:


[B] Gangetic Plains: Lower wind speeds (average 2-4 m/s) due to flat terrain.


[C] Western Ghats: Mountainous terrain disrupts wind flow, reducing potential.


[D] The Himalayas: Turbulent winds and complex terrain limit wind energy potential.


India's Wind Energy Potential:


1. Estimated potential: 302 GW (at 100m hub height)
2. Installed capacity (2022): 40 GW


Major Wind Energy States:


1. Tamil Nadu
2. Gujarat
3. Maharashtra
4. Karnataka

### That is correct!


The Deccan Plateau region has the highest potential for wind energy in India due to its favorable geography and climate. Some of the key factors that contribute to its high wind energy potential include:


1. High wind speeds: The Deccan Plateau receives strong winds from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, with average wind speeds ranging from 5-7 m/s.
2. Large land area: The Deccan Plateau covers a vast area, providing ample space for wind farms.
3. Low topography: The region's relatively flat terrain allows for smooth wind flow, making it ideal for wind energy generation.
4. Proximity to coastal areas: The Deccan Plateau's proximity to the coast enhances wind flow, further increasing its wind energy potential.


Some of the major wind energy-producing states in the Deccan Plateau region include:


1. Tamil Nadu
2. Maharashtra
3. Karnataka
4. Andhra Pradesh


These states have already installed significant wind energy capacity and continue to lead India's wind energy growth.
