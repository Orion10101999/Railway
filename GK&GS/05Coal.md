## Q.6. Neyveli of Tamil Nadu is famous for which of the following coal deposit ?

[A] Bituminous

[B] Anthracite

[C] Lignite

[D] Peat

The correct answer is:


[C] Lignite


Neyveli in Tamil Nadu is famous for its lignite coal deposits. Lignite is a type of soft, brownish-black coal that is often referred to as "brown coal." It is a relatively soft and low-rank coal, with a high moisture content and a low carbon content.


The Neyveli Lignite Corporation (NLC) is a public sector undertaking that mines lignite from the Neyveli mines and uses it to generate electricity. The NLC is one of the largest lignite mining companies in India.


Other options are incorrect:


- Bituminous coal is a higher-rank coal than lignite, with a higher carbon content and a lower moisture content. It is not found in Neyveli.
- Anthracite is a hard, high-rank coal that is not found in Neyveli.
- Peat is a type of soil made up of partially decayed plant matter and is not a type of coal.


Note: Lignite is an important energy source in India, and the Neyveli lignite mines are a significant contributor to the country's energy production.

## Coal :-

Coal is a fossil fuel formed from the remains of ancient plants that have undergone significant changes over millions of years. It is primarily composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and other elements.


Types of Coal:


1. Anthracite (hard coal): High carbon content (95%), low volatility, and high energy density.
2. Bituminous (soft coal): Medium carbon content (45-86%), medium volatility, and medium energy density.
3. Sub-bituminous: Lower carbon content (35-45%), higher moisture content.
4. Lignite (brown coal): Low carbon content (25-35%), high moisture content.
5. Peat: Soft, partially decayed plant matter.


Coal Uses:


1. Electricity generation
2. Steel production
3. Cement manufacturing
4. Industrial processes
5. Domestic heating


Coal Mining Methods:


1. Surface mining (open-pit)
2. Underground mining (room and pillar, longwall)


Coal Benefits:


1. Energy security
2. Economic growth
3. Job creation


Coal Environmental Concerns:


1. Greenhouse gas emissions
2. Air pollution
3. Water pollution
4. Land degradation
5. Health impacts


Coal Reserves:


1. Australia: 144.8 billion tonnes
2. China: 126.2 billion tonnes
3. United States: 110.3 billion tonnes
4. India: 60.6 billion tonnes

1. Electricity generation (thermal power plants)
2. Industrial processes (cement, paper, textile)
3. Domestic heating
4. Fertilizer production


Advantages:


1. Abundant reserves
2. Low extraction costs
3. Local energy source


Disadvantages:


1. Low energy density

## Types of Coal :-


There are several types of coal, classified based on their carbon content, moisture levels, and geological formation:


Main Types of Coal:


1. Anthracite (Hard Coal)
    - Highest carbon content (95%)
    - Lowest moisture content (2-5%)
    - Hardest and densest coal
    - High energy density
2. Bituminous (Soft Coal)
    - Medium carbon content (45-86%)
    - Medium moisture content (2-15%)
    - Soft and dense coal
    - Medium energy density
3. Sub-bituminous
    - Lower carbon content (35-45%)
    - Higher moisture content (15-30%)
    - Softer than bituminous coal
    - Lower energy density
4. Lignite (Brown Coal)
    - Lowest carbon content (25-35%)
    - Highest moisture content (30-50%)
    - Soft and brittle coal
    - Low energy density
5. Peat
    - Soft, partially decayed plant matter
    - High moisture content (50-90%)
    - Low energy density


Other Types of Coal:


1. Semi-anthracite
    - Carbon content between anthracite and bituminous
    - Density and energy density higher than bituminous
2. Coking Coal
    - Special type of bituminous coal used in steel production
    - Low sulfur and phosphorus content
3. Non-coking Coal
    - Used for thermal power generation and industrial processes
4. Steam Coal
    - Used for electricity generation and industrial processes
5. Metallurgical Coal
    - Used for steel production and other metallurgical applications


Classification Based on Geological Formation:


1. Gondwana Coal (India, Australia, Antarctica)
2. Tertiary Coal (Indonesia, Philippines)
3. Carboniferous Coal (Europe, North America)


Classification Based on Sulfur Content:


1. Low-sulfur coal (<1% sulfur)
2. Medium-sulfur coal (1-3% sulfur)
3. High-sulfur coal (>3% sulfur)


These classifications help determine the suitability of coal for various applications, such as electricity generation, steel production, and industrial processes.
